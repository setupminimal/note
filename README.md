# note

note is a command-line application that takes notes in a notes file for the current directory, or one of its parent directories. (Kind of like how git can work from anywhere in a repository.)

note allows you to type things like `note that this is recorded in a .notes file` and `note also that I like cheese`. You can view your notes with `note list`, or just `note`.

I hope this little tool is as useful for you as it is for me. The `.notes` files are in org-file format (ish).
